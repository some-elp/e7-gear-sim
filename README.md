# Gear Enhancement Simulator for Epic Seven
The purpose of this web application is to help users understand the difference between a gear worth rolling and a gear that should be tossed away. All enhancement data is from the official Smilegate post detailing enhancement odds.
The link to the webpage is here: https://some-elp.github.io/e7-gear-sim/
## Gear Roll Gacha
Users can input the gear's tier and level, along with substats, after which you can hit enhance and see what rolls you get on your gear.
## Evaluate Gear
By inputting piece, set, mainstat, and substats, the page will give the user a percentage chance of the gear being usable. "Usability" is currently defined as a gear that meets the requirements for a unit archetype and ends with all substats average or better. This is a flawed definition that will be changed later.
